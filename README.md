PIG GAME! ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The game is a fun way to practice JavaScript, DOM manipulation, and styling with CSS by building an interactive user interface.
ðŸ“š What I learned
Handling DOM events (addEventListener) for rolling dice, holding score, and restarting the game
Manipulating CSS classes dynamically (classList.add, classList.remove, classList.toggle)
Updating HTML content and styles on the fly (textContent, style properties)
Using conditional logic to control game flow and player turns
Structuring a game loop and managing game state variables
Applying modern CSS techniques for layout, styling, and transitions
